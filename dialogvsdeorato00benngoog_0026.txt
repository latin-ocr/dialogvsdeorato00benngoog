acquired fame as an orator and advocate, rising successively
to the offices of quaestor, tribune, and praetor. ln the
Drirtogus he appears in a double nile. Against Maternus he
defends the attractions of his chosen profession as compared
with those of poetry, while against Messalla he defends the
claims of contemporary oratory as compared with that of
earlier days. ln style he is represented as bold, enthusiastic‚
, prone to exaggeration, and inclined to rely upon his natural
endowments rather than upon profundity of learning.
Occasionally he stoops to sophistry, as iu his remarks
upon the meaning of the term urrtr'qurrs in cla. 16 ff. In
a word he represents the practical and useful, his general
altitude being well embodied in his own lauguage (5. 5),
ad utilitatem vitae orrrrrr‘a rorrsr'trir sirctuquc nostra dirigendi
srrnt.

Juerus Secuwnus, like Aper, was born in Gaul, and like
him had come to Rome aud devoted himself to oratory.

ln other respects the two rnen present the strongest con·

trast. Secundus was modest and retiring3 he lacked Aper's ,

aggressiveness, and apparently never held public office. As
· a speaker he was deficient in tire and spontaneity, and rvas
distinguished rather for the purity of his diction and the
polish of his style. Hence many criticised him as lacking
in promptus rernm (2. 3), and even his friend Quintilian, who
speaks of him as mirae fircumtirre viram, nevertheless ex·
presses regret that he was not rrrrrlto magis pugnax. Secun-
dus’s forte evidently rvas composition rather than delivery.
Hence he had naturally devoted himself to historical writing‚
and had already won favorable comment for his Life ry
Julius Africanus (14. 5). Quite consistent too with this is
the tone of chapters 3⁶·40· 1, which are best referred to
Secundus. This entire passage, with its historical detail
aad references to sources, exactly lits the character of the
historian Secundus.
