I'REFACE.

‚400—

lv 1891 the editors-inchiel ol the l'ollege Series asked
me to prepare lor publication the manuscript notes on the
Dialogus lelt by the late Professor Lucius lleritage ol
the University ol Wisconsin. l acceded to their request‚
expecting that my task would consist mainly in clerical
revision. An examination ol lllr. llcritage's manuscript,
however, showed that his edition ‹lillered materially in
scope lrom the other books ol the series; moremur, since

its preparation in 1883-84‚ the progressui critical study

on the Dialogus had been unusually rapid. Under these?

circumstances it seetned necessary to recast the wor

3 entirely, aud l accordingly did so.
ln the execution ol this taslr Ihavc received important
help lrom Prolessor Allred Gudeman ol the University ol
'Pennsylvania who generously put at my disposal the
exhaustive materiale ol his forthcoming edition ol the
Dialogus, and who has also assisted me lreely in other

ways.
