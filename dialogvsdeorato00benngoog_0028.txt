inimicitiarum glareis, in 40. r. llut il we attribute the latter
passage to Secundus, aad regard the tormer as Maternus's
rejoinder, all difficulty disappears.

Agaim it we attribute chapters 36 n. to Maternus, we smd
him giving utterance to sentimenta at rariance with those
previously expressed by him in the course ot the discussion.
Thus the enthusiastic allusion to the intluence ol the earlier
orators in 36. 5, lrr' clientelis crium merorum arationum redun-
dabant, hos ituri r'rt prm-iacias nrogr'strutns merebantur, lms
marsi colebant, los etprortrrrur ct cousrrlrrtns rurore ultro vidc-

uantur, is inconsistent with the contempt ol such honors
expressed ia ¹3· a, licet illos certamina etpcrr'culu sno nd rotr-

2. Furthermore chapters 30-40. 1 accord excellently with
the character of Secundus as historian and antiquarum in
which he appears in the discussion. 'she chapters in
question are in the nature ol an historical resument the
development and course ot oratory at Rome.

We shall therefore do best to recognize Secundus as the
speaker in all that follows the lacuna at the beginning ot
chapter 36 as tar as 40. r quos oratoribus sarrs admovebant.
Atthis point we must assume asecond lacuna and assign
to Maternus the passage lrom 4⁰· 2 (nou de otiosa etc.) to
tlte close ol 4¹·
