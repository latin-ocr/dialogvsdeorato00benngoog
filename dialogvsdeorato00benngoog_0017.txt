ῐ. AUTllORSllll‘ OF 'l'llli l)thOGUS.

As compared with the admitted works oi Tacitus (the
Agricola, Germania, llistorim, and Anionis), the Diadume
unquestionably exhibits marked (litierences ol languagc and
style. 'l'his circumstance led scholars, as carly as the time
ol Beatus Rhenanus (1485--1547)‚ to question the manu·
script testimony as to the 'l'acitean authorship ol the picco.
Rhenanus in spite oi his suspicions published the loolopo
(1519) under 'l'acitus's name, but Justus Lipsius (1547-
rbod), in his edition publishcd at olntwerp in i 574, in·
fluenced by certain resemblanccs to tbe Instilntio Orirtoria,
boldly ascribed the work to Quintilian and published it
under the title: filioli err'rrliliam', nl ron-mr, Dialogues,
Chrnelm Dicito firlso inscriptas. ln his third edition, how·
ever, published in 1585, Lipsius conlo-ssed his doubts asto
the propriety ol ascribing the work to Quintilian, maintain-
ing nevertheless as stoutly as ever that Tacitus could not
be the author.

Since Lipsius hrst launchcd the controversy upon the
learned world, over three hundred years ago, the question
ol the authorship oi the Dialogus has been an almost
constant subject ol discussiim. Lipsius's immediate suc-
cessors adopted in general his view as to the nonTacitean
authorship ol the picce. Some went lurther and attributed
it to Pliny the Younger‚ to Maternus, or even to Suetonius 3
while others adopted Lipsius's earlier view and ascribed
the work to Quintilian. Defenders ol the Tacitean author·
