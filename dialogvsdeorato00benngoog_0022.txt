e. ln Dial. all-30 the writer toucbes upon the important
part formerly played by the mother in the training ol
children, and with this decaying custom contrasts the
existiag conditions by which children were olten handed
over to nurses and worthless servants: 28. 5 eron in celin
emptae nutricis, sed in gremio ac sinn uralris urrunnun,- ²9· r
al nuuc unlus inseras delegalur Graeculae alicrci ancillae, cni ,
“ ananguur rences arel aller ex omnibus seruis, plerumque
vilissimus. With these passages compare the following,

where the similarity ol language as well as ol thought is par· ,

ticulnrly striking: Agna maler Iulia Procilla suil, rarae

Ger. ao sua quemque ucaler celeribus alil, uec aucillis aul

d. The characterizntions oi public men in the Dialogus
agree with the characterizations ol the smne men as found '
in the ffislories and Annals. Thus in Dial. Μ Eprius
Marcellus is accinclus el nrinou‚· in Arici. XVl. ²9 torrens ac
minax: Hisl. lV. 4³ unitatibus arelas. So also like judg-
ments are expressed concerning Vatinius in Dial. 11 and
Ana. XV. 343 concerning Pomponius Secundus in Dial.
¹3· 4 and Anci. Xll. 28; concerning Vipstanus Messalla
in Dial. ¹5 and Hisl. IV. 423 while the lull account
given in Hisl. IV. 43 oi the conflict in tlre Senate between
Heluidius Priscus and Eprius Marcellus reads like an
amplification oi the allusion to the same event iound in
Dial. 5.

e. ltis a striking peculiarity ol the Dialogus and Aricials
that they both reckon the beginning ol Augustus’s reign
irum his first consulship in 43 nc„ and not irom the battle
ol aenum, or lrorn bis assumption ol the title Augustus,

, as do other writers.
