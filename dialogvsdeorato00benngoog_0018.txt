ship were rare lor over two hundred years alter Lipsius's
third edition. lt was not until the beginning oi the present
century that a decided reaction set in in lavor ol Tacitus.
Since that time the evidence that the Dialogus is his work
has gradually been more and. more iully presented, and
more and more generally accepted as valid. Few scholars
. today deny Tacitus's title to the authorship.

consider that the Dialogus is lound almost exclusively in
MSS. which contain the Germanus also, it will be seen

2. Although in general the contrast in diction and style
between the Dialogus and the acknowledged writings ol
Tacitus is great, yet a careiul examination reveals striking
evidences ol a common authorship‚ and even enables us to

trace the genetic development ol Tacitus's style iaom the -

Dialogus (his earliest work) to the Auuols (his latest).
