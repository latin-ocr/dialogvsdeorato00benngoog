twrttooucinos. xiii

The above evidence may be brietly summarized as follows :
The MSS. are unanimous in ascribing the work to· 'l'acitus;
a comparison ol diction, syntax, and style shows a number-
οἱ striking resemblances that can hardly be fortuitous;
while the general point oi view ol the writer oi the Driiligns ,
and oi the works admitted to have been written by 'Tacitus is
the same. hloreover‚ nothing inconsistent with the 'l'acitean
authorship oi the Dialogus can be advanced beyond the
discrepancy ol style. lloth the dramatlc date ol the
dialogue itselt and the probahle date ol composition and
publication tally periectly with wlmt we know ol Tacitus.
Under these circumstances we may salely accept the view
- that Tacitus was the author.

lls regards the dislerence in style between the Dillio-<os
and 'Tacitus’s later worlrs we must consider not only the
difference in subject matter, bnt also the ‹litlerenee in time
· ol composition. 'l'he most probahle date lor the com-
position and publication oi the Dorligns is 81 an. From
then until the publication ol the Animis in 115-117 am. was
a period ol over thirty years. Between the Dialogus and the
Agricola (98 nm.) seventeen ycars elapscd. hloreover the
period intervenlng between the composition ol the two
works was occupied by the reign ot Domitian, the banelul
character oi which had made the ‹leepest irnpression upon
Tacitus. Cl. Agr. 1 l. Under these circumstances, and
aiter so great a lapse oi time, his style may well have taken
on a different character. Nor are such ‹lislerences without
parallel in other writers. Α similar development is notice·
able in Carlyle, and the disserence between his LijciffScliilicr
and his Frederick lire Greot has been aptly compared with
that between the Dialogus and the ilnnols.
