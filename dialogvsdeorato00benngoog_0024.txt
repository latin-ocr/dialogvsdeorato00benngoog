INTRODUCTION.

11. DthithC DATE OF 'iiiii ttratmnttc.

The time when the dialogue is represented as taking place,
was the latter hali oi 74 or the sust hali oi 75 nn. 'l‘his we
' ¹ gader irom 17. ³· where one ol the speakers relers to the
sextam iam sclr'cr's liuius priarr'palus startrlmcm quo l‘ispasr'auus

in the vicinity oi twenty, varying irotn the eighteenth to the
twenty-third year, which agrees periectly with the age oi
Tacitus at the tirne oi the dialogue. For he was probably
born in 55 or 56 a.n., and would accordingly have been
eighteen at the youngcst‚ at the oldest not more than
twenty. Further confirmation oi the date oi the discus·

to Mucianus, the well-known supporter oi Vespasian, who
is mentioned as actively engaged in collecting materials ior
an historical work which he had projected. But Mucianus
was probably no longer alive in 77, so that the discussion
must have taken place beiore that date.

ν lt is more difficolt to determine when the Dialogus was
eomposed and published, F rent the reference oi the author
to himseli as iaromir admodum at the time oi the discussion,

between the discussion itseli and the composition oi the
