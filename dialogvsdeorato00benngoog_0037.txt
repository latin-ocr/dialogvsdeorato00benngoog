Arsn’s ilrnnsssros (16-23l. Aper tirst enters upon
a sophistical argument as to the meaning oi the word
antiquus. He maintains that the term cannot properly
be applied to Cicero and his contemporaries3 ior they are
separated from the present by less than the iimit oi a human

' lite. T he real antiqui oraton-s arc Appius Claudius, Cato,

Carb0, Galba, and the Gracchi. Cicero and his contem·
poraries belong rather to an intermediate era, -- ii anything,
nearer the present thau the past. Moreover the character
01 oratory varies with the times, and no single type is
to be summarily condemned simply because it diliers irem
another. Men always idealize the past, and underestimate
the present. 'i‘he new oratory really marks a great advance
upon what preceded. it is brilliant and elaborate in
style, whereas the earlier orators were ‹lry and tedious. dn
audienee oi today, declares Aper, would no longer tolerate
such speakers. i‘eople now wam something ornate and
striking—something to rememher and talk about. Calvus,
Brutus, Asinius, aud (Torviuus wer⁸e ali faulty, and even
Cicero, praised though he is hy some, is worthy oi admira·

tion only in his latest speeches.

(aa-3 5). Messaiia, urged by Maternus to luitill the promise
alreadygiven (in chapter m), tirst defends the orators of the
Ciceronian cra against the attacks 01 Aper, maintaining that
aii were worthy ol praise, each in his way. Contemporary
oratory, on the other hand, he asserts, descends to mere·
tricious devices, and is {intuorthy oi respect. Reminded
again by Maternus that he had promised to set iorth the
causes oi the decline 01 eloquence, Messalla declares that
they are really very obvious. According to his view the
prime cause is neglect in the training oi the young. Formerly
the mother superintended personally the education oi her
sons. Now these are given over to slaves aad nurses.
