ln earlier days too it used to be the custom for a young
man preparing for the orato'rical profession to attach himself
to some jurist or advocate, to follow him day by day, in
court and before the people, and thus learn his profession
by practical experience. 'l'oday‚ complains Messalla, it is

the fashion to declaim suasoriae and corttrotvrsr'ae in the ,

school of some rhetor, ss—u'ith results that are too well known
to require furtlrer comment. (The speech breaks off in a
lacuna.)

Securvovs's Svsscrr (36-40. r.-The first part of the
speech is lost in the lacuna). Secundus gives an lristorical
review of the causes leading to the development of oratory
at Rome, ria. the strife of parties and the general politica}
restlessness which agitated the state. Oratory was favored
too by the mode of procedure in the courts. Liberal time
used to be afforded for speaking, and the number of counsel
was not limited, whereas today every sort of restrictiori and
impediment confronts the advocate. (The speech breaks
off in a lacuna.)

tta-rennues Cnosrvo Svescrr (ao. ato end).-'l'he first
part is lost Referring to Secundus's last remarks, Maternus
shows from them that eloquence is the child of discord,
turbulente, and violence, that its existence is consequently
aa index of unsettled political conditions aad defective
govemment Why, therefore, should we deplore its deca-
denoe? Let us enjoy the advantages ·of our own time,
aad not regret the lack of what we do not need.
